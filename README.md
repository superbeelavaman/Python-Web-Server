#Read Me First!
This is a web server made entirely in python.
This web server currently only supports images,
but that's a limitation that will be fixed by
someone that knows how to get it to work.

###Instructions:
1. Download the repository into any folder on your computer.
2. Edit settings.py with the correct settings.
3. Run Webserver.py
4. if you want to add an html document, just drag & drop it into the html folder. (No restarting the server. Yay.)
